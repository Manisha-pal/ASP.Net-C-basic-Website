# Website
This is just a SPA I made for assignment in an hour using validation controls and regular expression controls in C#.
Site1.master is the main index page of the website that drives the website. It contains a header and footer. 
A content holder has been created in the table of the master page where other Web forms can show their content too accordingly.
